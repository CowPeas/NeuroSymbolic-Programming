# NeuroSymbolic-Programming

This is a playground for learning and playing with neurosymbolic-programming.
  
Neurosymbolic programming (NSP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to combine the power of symbolic reasoning with the adaptability and learning capabilities of neural networks. 

NSP seeks to bridge the gap between symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches to AI by integrating logic-based reasoning with neural network-based learning.
